# Statistical Analysis of Marathon Data

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of marathon data. Utilizing datasets from various marathons, we delve into exploring and understanding the intricacies and trends within the marathon running community.

## Dataset
The primary focus is on the marathon data from the year 2015 and 2019. This dataset includes a wide range of information such as runner's name, age, gender, nationality, race times at different checkpoints, and overall performance.

## Key Features
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: The initial steps involve cleaning the data, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: A thorough EDA is conducted to understand the distribution of various variables like age, gender, and performance metrics. This is crucial to gain insights and guide further analysis.
3. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Basic statistical measures like mean, median, mode, variance, etc., are calculated to understand the data's central tendency and spread.
   - **Inferential Statistics**: Advanced statistical techniques are applied to draw inferences about the larger population of marathon runners, based on the sample data.
4. **Data Visualization**: The use of graphs and plots such as histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots to visually represent the data and highlight key patterns and trends.

## Libraries Used
- Pandas and Numpy for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Statsmodels for conducting statistical tests and models.
